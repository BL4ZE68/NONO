# NONO

A small interactive HTML project with animated gradient background and simple image/text features.

## Features

- Animated gradient background and ripple title effects.
- `index.html` includes a UI to upload one or multiple images and add text captions.
- Each image card has an editable caption (Edit / Save) so you can associate different text with each image.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve with a static server).
2. Use the controls to select image(s) and enter text; click **Ajouter** to add to the gallery.
3. Edit captions per-image using the **Éditer** / **Sauvegarder** buttons.

## Development

- Files:
  - `index.html` — main UI and logic

To save changes and push:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\pc-hp\Desktop\code\Nono"
git add .
git commit -m "Update"
git push
```
